			<h1>Meet Jibran</h1>
			<p>Jibran Najmi was born in Sunnyvale, California, but got to Dallas-Fort Worth as fast as he could. His journey to DFW took several detours, taking him and his family through New York, Paris, Dubai, and Singapore. Jibran's past experiences have developed his ability to connect with people, empathize with their needs, and help them achieve their goals. His international experiences and exposure provided the opportunity to become conversationally fluent in several languages including Spanish and Urdu.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>After graduating from Plano West Senior High School, he attended Texas A&amp;M University as a Political Science/International Studies double major. He returned home to care for his family, and in 2009 moved to Arlington, TX. Currently, he is a Junior Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Texas.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>Prior to becoming a REALTOR&reg;, Jibran spent 15+ years in the hospitality industry where he found a passion for people, service, and delivering unique, memorable and personal experiences. As a member if the National Association of REALTORS&reg;, Jibran is committed to delivering exceptional service to all of his clients by leveraging technology to make real estate simple and understandable.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>Jibran is passionate in helping people make their real estate dreams come true. Success in real estate is not measured by the number of closed transactions, but by the quality of the relationships created over a lifetime. If you or someone you know is thinking of buying, selling, or investing in real estate, please reach out to let Jibran know!</p>
